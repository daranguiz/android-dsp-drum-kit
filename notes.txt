Workshop notes:

- Figure out your phone's approximate sampling rate:
    * Only collect one channel
    * matlab/python - get approximate sampling rate
- Download a file explorer app
- using LINEAR_ACCELERATION instead of pure ACCELERATION, why?

Files with TODO flags:
- Android:
    * GestureRecognizer
